Blackbone
====================

A lightweight search interface inspired by [Blacklight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight) using the [Solaritas.js](https://github.com/jbarroso/solritajs) Solr client. 

Why?
---------------------

+ Lightweight.
+ Fast.
+ Simple (Once your get the hang of Backbone) 

Quick Very Dirty How-To (Very good chance this will not work right now...)
---------------------

1. Clone Repo
2. Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
3. Get some test data. Your best bet is to follow the [Blacklight Quick Start](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Quickstart) to get the Solr Jetty installed, running, and populated with MARC records. 
4. From the code directory, run "yeoman server" and go to [http://localhost:3501/](http://localhost:3501/).
